# 🛰️ Status — cross-account orchestration board

> Two people, two accounts, two machines, one repo. This file is the async
> message board between them — update your section every session, before you
> stop and before the other side starts. Keep entries short: what's done,
> what's next, anything blocking. Full context lives in the branch's commits,
> not here.

## Branches
- `feat/backend-phase0` — backend work (this laptop's other account).
  Executes [[Opus-Execution-Plan]] starting at Phase 0.
- `feat/ui-redesign` — UI/UX work (this account, this laptop).
- `main` — only merge into this once a branch is stable and reviewed. Don't
  push work-in-progress directly to `main`.

## Workflow (both sides)
1. **Pull `main` before starting a session** — `git checkout <your-branch> &&
   git merge main` (or rebase if you prefer) — to avoid basing work on stale
   code.
2. **Push small, push often** — commit in reviewable chunks, not one giant
   diff at the end of a session.
3. **Update your section below before ending a session.**
4. **Merge to `main` via PR**, not a direct push, once a phase/feature is done
   — gives the other side a clean point to pull from.

## Backend — **P1 MERGED TO MAIN (PR #5, e6155d7, 2026-07-13)**
- **Status:** `main` now carries P0 + P1 seams + zero-spend Gemini config +
  the SSRF fix. **38 tests passing on merged main.** Deploy/prove-it should
  build from `main` — no more branch juggling.
- **Last update:** 2026-07-13
- **Done (new since last entry):**
  - **SSRF fix LANDED** (5d85a73, review finding #1): route-level prefix
    allowlist for `image_url` (fail closed; derived from `SUPABASE_URL` public
    storage path or `IMAGE_URL_ALLOWED_PREFIX`; checked *before* the quota
    claim), no-redirect fetch with content-type check + hard 4MB mid-stream
    cap (`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`), refunded `IMAGE_REJECTED` SSE error distinct from
    `LLM_UNAVAILABLE`.
  - **P1 merged via PR #5** — all three seam increments (model plane split w/
    Router-owned failover; `retrieval/vector.py`; thin `ask.py` +
    `orchestrator/pipeline.py`) + `GEMINI_MODEL` env config for the zero-spend
    phase. `core/llm.py` / `core/rag.py` remain as one-release re-export shims.
  - **Rule override, recorded:** merged ahead of the live e2e prove-it on the
    user's direct instruction (2026-07-13). The byte-exact mocked SSE test is
    the interim equivalence baseline; the prove-it now runs against `main`
    directly and doubles as P1's live validation.
- **Next (backend lane):** P2 multi-retrieval (FTS + RRF merge) is the next
  plan phase — but the **eval harness (P3) is the highest-leverage gap**
  (nothing can be proven better/worse until it exists). Also open: review
  finding #2, `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` (small; frontend workaround exists).
- **Deploy account, note:** with P1 on `main`, the ₹0 deploy needs
  `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash` in `--set-env-vars` (see zero-spend
  guardrails below). `IMAGE_URL_ALLOWED_PREFIX` is optional — it defaults to
  `SUPABASE_URL` + `/storage/v1/object/public/`; images from any other origin
  are now rejected with 400 (fail closed: if `SUPABASE_URL` is unset, ALL
  image questions 400).
- **Blocking:** none.

## Adaptive-loop — **A.0–A.2 merged; A.3 pipeline in [PR #11](https://github.com/aksharaverse/AITutor/pull/11); content is now the blocker** (2026-07-17)
- **Status:** design + A.0 + A.1 on `main` (PRs #6, #7, **#8 `c317331`**,
  **#9 `fb90092`**). **A.2 = [PR #10](https://github.com/aksharaverse/AITutor/pull/10), open**
  — the Mechanics KC graph + a validating ingest tool. **192 tests pass**
  (126 + 66). No routes/orchestrator/models touched by any of them.
- **A.2 shipped:** `content/kc/phy_mechanics.yaml` — **57 KCs, 86 edges, longest
  chain 10, 1 component, 0 cycles, 0 isolated** · `app/ingest/kc_graph.py` (pure:
  parse/validate/metrics/topo/dot) · `app/ingest/kc.py` (`--check` = no DB;
  `--dot` = Graphviz; upsert is one transaction, never partial).
  `requirements.txt += PyYAML` (app/ingest ships in the container, so it's a real
  runtime dep). New: [[ADR-013]] (telemetry sets KC granularity, not a target
  number — 57 is coherent, not aimed at) and [[ADR-014]] (the ingest tool is the
  graph's integrity boundary, because Postgres cannot express acyclicity).
- **🔴🔴 CONTENT LANE — the chapter string is now a contract.** `chunks.chapter`
  is `PHY::optics::12` and retrieval filters on **exact string equality**
  (`where chapter = $2`). A KC with `chapter: Mechanics` matches **zero chunks**,
  so "explain this item" would silently retrieve nothing and look like a bad
  prompt. The seed declares **`PHY::mechanics::11`** and the validator enforces
  the format. **Whoever RAG-ingests mechanics notes must use exactly:**
  `python -m app.ingest.cli notes/mechanics.md --subject PHY --chapter PHY::mechanics::11`
  (the trailing number follows the existing `::12` convention = NCERT class,
  inferred — if that's wrong, say so and it's a one-line YAML fix, but both sides
  must match).
- **🔴 A.1's migration (now on `main`) has STILL NOT been executed against any
  database.** Docker's daemon was down on this machine, so no fresh-DB apply was
  possible — it is *reviewed, not proven*, and merging didn't change that.
  Someone with Docker or the Supabase CLI must run `supabase db reset` (or psql
  against `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` with `auth.users` stubbed — command in
  `backend/tests/test_migration_hygiene.py`'s docstring) **before** it goes near
  live. That plus the ledger reconciliation are the two gates on `db push`.
  A.2's ingest tool cannot be run against a real DB until this is done either
  (`--check` works with no DB and is what's been exercised).
- **🔴 There is NO CI in this repo** (`.github/workflows/` does not exist). The
  126 tests only ever run on whoever's laptop remembers to run them. This is now
  the biggest infrastructure gap: it's also where the schema-drift check belongs
  (migration → fresh DB → introspect → compare against a snapshot), which would
  have caught the drift ADR-011 was written about. **Suggest the infra lane take
  this next** — it's small (pytest + a postgres service container) and it
  unblocks trusting any of the above.
- **A.1 deviated from the design in 3 ways, all found by implementing it** —
  backend lane should know before writing B.1:
  1. **`item_state` is a new table; `items.difficulty` no longer exists**
     ([[ADR-012]]). Content and derived state can't share a table — A.3's
     `content_hash` re-ingest would clobber learned difficulty, and `rebuild()`
     would write to the content table.
  2. **`student_kc_state` has `p_correct`/`confidence`/`estimator` columns**
     (§3.2 omitted them). Without a stored `p_correct` the policy would have to
     recompute it from `rating` with Elo's formula in SQL — hard-coding the
     estimator into the policy, exactly what [[ADR-005]] forbids. The schema has
     to honour the ADR too, not just the Python.
  3. **`attempts.correct` is NULLABLE on purpose** — null = "not gradeable" = a
     Verdict of INAPPLICABLE. Don't default it to false.
  Also: `kc_edges` blocks self-loops but **cannot** block longer cycles (A→B→A)
  — Postgres can't express it. **A.2's seed ingest must check reachability.**
- **🆕 Engineering metrics to instrument alongside the product KPIs**
  ([[Adaptive-Loop-Architecture]] §4.1): `rebuild()` wall time per student ·
  `/v1/next` p50/p95 (the "one SQL query" claim, measured) · event-log growth
  per student/day · attempts-per-KC-to-mastery (tells us if KC granularity is
  wrong, measured instead of argued) · `p_correct` calibration error (ECE) ·
  item-state coverage. Each is a query, not a project; land each with the phase
  that makes it measurable (B.1/B.2).
- **What A.0 landed:** `app/adaptive/contracts.py` (KnowledgeState, KCMastery,
  AttemptEvent, StateDelta, NextRequest, NextDecision + StateEstimator/Policy
  Protocols) · `app/verify/registry.py` (dispatch + aggregation) ·
  `app/verify/checkers/gold.py` (first real checker) · widened
  `app/verify/base.py`.
- **🆕 ADRs now exist — `docs/Decisions/` (ADR-001…011), on `main`.** Tiny
  records (Decision / Context / Reason / Consequences, ~35 lines) of the calls
  that look weird without their reason. **Both sides: read the ADR before
  "fixing" something odd, and add one when you make a call a future reader would
  question.** The module docstrings point at the relevant record, so you'll hit
  them from the code. Index + when-not-to-write-one → `docs/Decisions/README.md`.
  The two corrections below are ADR-001 and ADR-002.
- **Also resolved:** [[Student-Model]]'s `#decision/open` BKT-vs-IRT-vs-Elo —
  **struck through, resolved to Elo** (ADR-007). It had been open since
  2026-06-28.
- **🔴 Backend account — two corrections that change what you'd have written:**
  1. **`verify/base.py` was widened in place; there is NO `verify/contracts.py`**
     (the doc's §7 originally said to create one). P1 had already locked
     `Verdict`/`Outcome`/`Verifier` in `base.py`, so a second contracts module
     would have meant two competing `Verdict` types. The widening is additive
     (`+Outcome.TIMEOUT`, `+Verdict.checker`, `+Claim`,
     `+name/domain/applies_to`) and P1's field names are kept — so **your P5
     checkers implement `Verifier` from `app.verify.base` and register on
     `Registry`**. §7 of the doc records this.
  2. **`StateEstimator.observe(ev, prior)`** takes the prior mastery as an
     argument (the doc's sketch said `observe(ev)`, which contradicted its own
     purity rule — Elo needs the current rating and a pure fn can't fetch it).
     B.1's EloEstimator implements that signature; the caller passes the row it
     already holds. `prior=None` = cold start.
- **Aggregation precedence is now `FAIL > TIMEOUT > PASS > INAPPLICABLE`**
  (pinned by a truth-table test). TIMEOUT outranks PASS deliberately: "3 passed,
  1 timed out" must abstain, not badge — directly relevant to P5's gate. A
  checker that raises degrades to INAPPLICABLE, never FAIL, and is logged.
- **Known, accepted A.0 limitation:** the gold checker's unit check is a
  normalized *string* compare, so `N/kg` != `m/s^2` (a false negative). Pinned
  by `test_dimensionally_equivalent_units_fail_until_pint_lands` — that test is
  **meant to fail and be deleted** when `pint` lands at P5.0. Use it to grade
  curated items; don't badge a student's own physics work on it before P5.
- **Why contracts first:** implementations churn (Elo → Student-JEPA; one
  checker → six), contracts don't. `KnowledgeState`, `Verdict`, and the
  `p_correct`-as-portable-unit convention are frozen before anything is built
  against them. Same discipline as P1's seams.
- **Next:** A.1 migrations → A.2 KC graph seed → A.3 item bank → B.1 Elo →
  B.2 routes → B.3 UI (order + gates in §7).
- **Review outcome (2026-07-16), things both sides should know:**
  - Phases A/B are **"JEPA-inspired"**, NOT JEPA — the name is only earned in
    Phase C, when an encoder actually predicts future latent states. Please use
    this wording externally (investors/paper); the earlier framing overstated it.
  - The verifier is a **Verification *Engine*** (registry + per-domain
    checkers: sympy · units · gold · chemistry · sandbox · SMT), not one
    checker. P5's checkers become registry entries — backend lane, note this.
  - **Event sourcing is now a rule:** `attempts`/`traces` append-only;
    `student_kc_state` is a *derived cache* that must be rebuildable by
    replaying the log. That property is what makes the Phase C estimator swap
    a re-run instead of a migration.
- **What it is:** the 2026-07-15 brainstorm (JEPA papers + Squirrel AI's
  closed loop + Cursor's loop→data→model sequence) compressed into a design
  on the existing stack: closed practice loop where the LLM is a *selectively
  invoked decoder* — adaptive decisions (next item, mastery, review
  scheduling) are pure SQL ≈ ₹0, fitting the zero-spend phase. Annotated
  research reading list included (KT/Elo/JEPA/RLVR/public datasets).
- **Key calls:** Elo state estimator v1 behind a `StateEstimator` Protocol
  (resolves [[Student-Model]]'s open BKT-vs-IRT-vs-Elo decision); additive
  migrations (`knowledge_components`, `kc_edges`, `items`, `attempts`,
  `student_kc_state`); `GET /v1/next` + `POST /v1/attempts`; phases A–D with
  gates (A log+graph → B Elo loop → C Student-JEPA, gated ≥100k attempts →
  D RLVR own model, gated on funding). Golden-set problems double as items
  (curate once, use twice with P3).
- **🆕🔴 SCHEMA WORKFLOW CHANGED — read before writing any SQL ([[ADR-011]], on
  `main`).** `backend/schema.sql` is **no longer the source of truth and must not
  be run**; it is now a pointer file. The schema lives in immutable, timestamped
  migrations under **`supabase/migrations/`** (baseline
  `20260716120000_baseline_p0_p1.sql` = the old schema.sql, squashed — verified
  lossless by object-set diff, but **not yet executed anywhere**). Rules,
  naming, apply flow → `supabase/README.md`.
  - *Why:* schema.sql was 16 `if not exists` guards pasted into the SQL editor
    by hand — guards that **silently no-op on drift**, so a diverged live DB
    reports "ran fine". Meanwhile the MCP wrote a real migration ledger into the
    live project on 2026-07-12 that this repo has no copy of. Two histories,
    neither aware of the other, and the authoritative one wasn't in git.
  - *New work:* `supabase migration new <name>` → one file → review → merge →
    `supabase db push`. Don't append to schema.sql. Don't use `if not exists` in
    new migrations. Prove it with a local `supabase db reset` (free, Docker) —
    that's the test that a migration builds an empty DB, not just your laptop.
- **🔴🔴 INFRA ACCOUNT — one-time reconciliation; it BLOCKS A.1's *push*.**
  The live project's ledger (`xdszkwjkaamyycirfslz`) and `supabase/migrations/`
  disagree, and **nobody currently knows what the remote ledger contains** — the
  Supabase MCP is disconnected from the agent side, so this needs your
  authenticated CLI (same class of blocker as gcloud). **Do not `supabase db
  push` against live until done.** Steps in `supabase/README.md` § "Reconciling
  the live project": `supabase link` → `supabase migration list` → **post that
  output here** → `migration repair` (ledger-only, does not touch tables) →
  verify → then push. **Writing A.1's migration file is NOT blocked** — only
  applying it to live is.
- **A.3 REPRIORITISED — it is a *content pipeline*, not "item sourcing"** (review
  2026-07-17). Steps 1-3 are engineering and are **DONE in
  [PR #11](https://github.com/aksharaverse/AITutor/pull/11)**; step 4 is the
  human blocker; B.1 waits for a validated corpus:
  1. ✅ item schema (`content/items/*.yaml`) + `items.slug` migration
  2. ✅ linter `app/ingest/item_spec.py` — **content is code; bad content fails
     like bad Python**, against files (no DB), so it runs in CI
  3. ✅ importer `app/ingest/items.py` — transactional, idempotent, `--check`
     needs no DB
  4. **split in two (review 2026-07-17) so the process ships apart from the data:**
     - **A.3a ✅ content operations — [PR #12](https://github.com/aksharaverse/AITutor/pull/12)**
       (stacked on #11). [[Content-Authoring]] = the one page a contributor reads:
       setup, the edit/--check loop, KC-tagging rules, gold conventions, the
       review checklist, batch workflow. **Its examples are executed by tests**,
       so it cannot rot into a lie. Deliverable: someone who has never seen this
       repo adds ten valid items.
     - **A.3b ⬜ first corpus — ~300 items. STILL NO OWNER.** Everything it needs
       now exists.
  5. ⬜ *then* B.1 (Elo), against a clean corpus instead of manual cleanup
- **🆕 Curation dashboard — `--check` now reports the numbers that inform, not
  the one that flatters.** Current honest state:
  `Items: 8 · KC coverage: 5/57 (8.8%) · Median items/KC: 0 · below floor: 57`.
  A raw item count hides everything: 300 items over 10 KCs is a question bank,
  and only the **median** makes that visible. **Breadth before depth** is now
  machine-checked (`LADDER_FLOOR=5`): the report flags any KC that got a 6th item
  while others sit below the floor, and lists the emptiest KCs to work next (ties
  broken by id, so two curators don't pick the same one). Reported, never
  enforced — coverage is curation status, not a broken file.
- **📌 Correction both sides should note: "the engine is done" was overstated.**
  Phase A finished the **static** infrastructure (contracts, persistence, domain
  model, content pipeline). The **dynamic** half is entirely unexercised — Elo
  updates, `rebuild()` replay, the policy, `/v1/next`, event generation — and
  each will surface another round of refinements, exactly as A.1/A.2/A.3 each
  did (the `p_correct` column, the chapter-string contract, the cp1252 crash,
  `slug` vs `content_hash` — none visible on paper). B.1 is where we find out.
- **📌 The risk has moved from architectural to operational.** Ranked:
  (1) **content throughput** — can we sustainably produce tagged items? (A.3a is
  the answer: process, not dataset); (2) **content quality** — a confidently
  wrong gold is the worst bug in the system: the student is right, is marked
  wrong, and Elo learns the opposite of the truth from every later attempt. No
  linter catches it — only human review ([[Content-Authoring]] §8);
  (3) **telemetry quality** — unlogged is unrecoverable, so this is the one that
  can't be fixed retroactively. Architecture is no longer the bottleneck.
- **New bar for engineering:** an abstraction earns its place only by solving a
  problem hit during Elo, policy execution, or curation — not by anticipated
  complexity. (Already applied: `KCId`/`ItemSlug`/`StudentId` domain types were
  proposed and **declined** — `ChapterId` earned it because two writers joined by
  exact string equality with no FK had already drifted; `kc_id` has an FK and
  `slug` has a unique constraint + a linter. No forcing function, no type.)
- **🔴 `chapter` is now a validated type, not free text — `app/ids.py::ChapterId`,
  grammar `SUBJECT::chapter_slug::grade`.** `app/ingest/cli.py --chapter` was
  free text with only a help string: two write boundaries producing an identifier
  that retrieval joins by **exact string equality with no FK**. Both write
  boundaries now parse one grammar. The read boundary (`/v1/ask`, retrieval) is
  deliberately NOT validated — a bad chapter there already returns empty, and
  tightening it would change live behaviour. `PHY::optics::12` still parses.
- **New ADRs:** [[ADR-015]] content ids are authored/immutable/never reused —
  `items.slug` exists because `content_hash` as a key meant *fixing a typo
  orphaned the item's attempts*; [[ADR-016]] an item the verifier cannot grade
  never enters the bank — every gold is checked by the real `GoldAnswerChecker`
  at lint time, because otherwise B.2 stores `correct = null` forever with
  nothing alerting.
- **Ontology versioning (asked, answered):** immutable ids make a version stamp
  unnecessary for *correctness* — a split is "add two, keep the old", so
  historical attempts always resolve to a KC that still means what it meant.
  `attempts.graph_hash` was considered and **rejected** (chapter-scoped, so a
  typo fix churns every unrelated row); provenance belongs on
  `student_kc_state`/a training run, when Phase C needs it. A `status`
  (active|deprecated|archived) column lands at the first real split, not before.
- **🔴 CONTENT LANE — the honest state, from the tool itself:**
  `Items: 8 · KCs covered: 5/57 · KCs with no items: 52`. The engine is done and
  the bank is ~3% full. Curation target ~300 = 57 KCs x ~5-6 (a KC with <5 items
  can be *served* but not *adapted over* — there's no difficulty ladder to
  select from). Sourcing = past JEE + NCERT exemplar (public), `kc` from
  `content/kc/phy_mechanics.yaml`, `answer` as `{value, unit}` or `{choices:[..]}`.
  `source` is REQUIRED (attribution). Symbolic-only answers are rejected until
  P5.0's sympy checker. **Do not build 5,000 before D7 is measured.**
- **(superseded note)** A.3 items were already flagged as the critical path: A.0/A.1/A.2 are done; the loop has a graph and nowhere to get
  questions. This is curation hours, not code — the only non-code thing between
  us and a measurable D7. Sourcing = past JEE papers + NCERT exemplar (public;
  same attribution rules as the P3 golden set), tagged with `kc_id` from
  `content/kc/phy_mechanics.yaml` and given `answer_gold` in the shape
  `GoldAnswerChecker` already reads: `{value, unit}` or `{choices: [...]}`.
  ~300 = 57 KCs x ~5-6 items for a difficulty ladder; **do not build 5,000 before
  D7 is measured** (inventory before demand = the Byju's/Doubtnut trap already in
  the Opus plan's lesson table).
- **Suggested lane split (needs both sides' ack):** backend account —
  Phase A/B server side (migrations + `adaptive/` + `routes/practice.py`,
  meshes after P1, parallel to P2/P3); UI account — practice screen + the
  missing feedback UI (same screen). Phase C is a research lane.
- **Blocking:** nothing blocks A.0/A.1/A.2/B.1 — start now.
  **The one human blocker is A.3:** sourcing ~150 items for the first chapter
  (NCERT exemplar + past JEE papers, same sourcing/attribution as the P3 golden
  set) **needs an owner** — it's curation hours, not code, and it's the line
  item this plan most underestimates. Tag the P3 golden problems with `kc_id`
  and they become the first items for free. First chapter should be whichever
  the golden set seeds from (Physics–Optics is already queued for ingest).

## UI/UX + Infra (`feat/ui-redesign`, `feat/deploy-cloudrun`)
- **Status:** in progress — UI redesign + owns live-infra/deploy lane
- **Last update:** 2026-07-12
- **Done (UI):** (carried over, not yet committed) modified `index.tsx`,
  `sign-in.tsx`, `thread/[id].tsx`, `Bubble.tsx`, `Input.tsx`, `Screen.tsx`,
  `theme.ts`; new `Branches.tsx`/`.web.tsx`, `Brand.tsx`, `Composer.tsx`,
  `DottedBackground.tsx`, `GoogleG.tsx`/`.web.tsx`, `entrance.ts`/`.web.ts`
- **Done (Infra):** Cloud Run deploy prep on `feat/deploy-cloudrun` (off
  `main`) — **fixed `backend/Dockerfile`** to honor `$PORT` (was hardcoded
  8080; Cloud Run contract) + `exec` for SIGTERM SSE drain; added
  `backend/deploy/cloudrun.sh` (deploy-from-source, `asia-south1`,
  scale-to-zero, Secret Manager, 600s SSE timeout). PR to `main` pending.
  *Backend account: the `$PORT` Dockerfile fix is on that branch — pull it
  before any deploy; it does NOT touch P1 files.*
- **Done (Infra — live DB, 2026-07-12):** P0.1/P0.2/P0.3 applied to live
  Supabase (`xdszkwjkaamyycirfslz`) as tracked migrations — now matches
  `main`'s `schema.sql`. RLS enabled on `chunks`, `billing_events`, **and
  `traces`** (new public table from P0.2, same exposure). All ERROR/critical
  security advisors cleared; only benign `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO remains
  (backend uses direct asyncpg / service-role, which bypass RLS — no policy
  needed). Pre-existing WARNs untouched (`vector` in `public`, Auth
  leaked-password protection off).
- **Next (Infra):**
  - install/auth `gcloud`, create Secret Manager secrets, run
    `bash backend/deploy/cloudrun.sh` → get service URL.
  - Wire `frontend/.env` API base + Stripe webhook to the URL; ingest
    Physics–Optics; run the P0 prove-it (produces P1's baseline SSE transcript).
- **Next (UI):** review + commit the carried-over redesign changes.
- **Blocking:** actual `gcloud run deploy` needs a human-authenticated GCP CLI
  (account/auth can't be done by the agent) — script is ready to run.

## 3-pass repo review (2026-07-12, UI account — full-branch audit)
Findings both sides should see. **Detailed write-ups now in the repo:**
combined → [[2026-07-12-review-combined]] (`docs/Reviews/`, on `main`);
per-lane → [[2026-07-12-review-ui-account]] (on `feat/ui-redesign`) and
[[2026-07-12-review-backend-account]] (on `feat/backend-phase0`).
Architecture re-validated by execution: `main` 23/23 tests, seams 29/29
in a clean worktree; Google OAuth wiring and Cloud Run deploy config
confirmed by inspection. Summary of the findings:
- **Frontend lags backend by a phase:** P0.3 is "done" on `main` but the app
  never sends `thread_id` (no follow-up questions) and has **no feedback UI**
  (👍/👎 endpoint unused → the data flywheel isn't being fed). These are the
  two highest-leverage UI tasks after the redesign merge.
- **Backend security gap (pre-deploy fix):** `/v1/ask` `image_url` is fetched
  server-side unvalidated in the Gemini path — SSRF on Cloud Run + no size/
  content-type cap (plan edge case #5 not yet implemented). Fix: allowlist the
  Supabase storage URL prefix, cap ~4MB, check content-type. Backend lane.
- **Missing endpoint:** no `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` — thread screen paginates
  up to 5 pages client-side to find one session; sessions older than ~100
  entries show "not found". Small backend add + frontend switch.
- **Critical path unchanged:** nothing is live e2e (gcloud deploy blocked on
  human auth), corpus is empty until Physics–Optics ingest → P0 prove-it →
  P1 merge. Everything else queues behind this.
- **Untracked market-impact items (no owner on this board):** the 100-problem
  Phase-0 dataset (gates P3 evals + P5 verifier — zero code, pure curation);

## Zero-spend deploy guardrails (2026-07-12, backend account — verified research)
Decision from the user: **₹0 total spend until the app is properly functional.**
Verified free-tier facts + required changes, for whoever runs the deploy:
1. **🔴 Code blocker: `gemini-2.5-pro` is NOT on the Gemini free tier anymore**
   (2.5 Flash / Flash-Lite are; embeddings `gemini-embedding-001` is). Our
   Gemini adapter hardcodes 2.5-pro → every vision/failover call fails on a
   free key. **Fix LANDED on the P1 branch (33e9d09):** adapter reads
   `GEMINI_MODEL` env at call time (default unchanged = 2.5-pro); zero-spend
   deploys add `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash` to `--set-env-vars`. Free Flash
   limits: 10 RPM / 250 req/day, resets midnight PT — plenty for the prove-it.
   ⇒ the prove-it/deploy should therefore run against the **P1 branch build**
   (or wait for P1's merge) — `main`'s adapter can't do ₹0 vision.
2. **Hard cap = two GCP projects.** Gemini API key from an AI Studio project
   with **no billing attached** (can't be charged — over-limit = 429, not a
   bill). Cloud Run lives in a separate project with billing + a kill switch:
   budget → Pub/Sub → function that detaches billing (official pattern:
   cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/disable-billing-with-notifications;
   turnkey: github.com/Cyclenerd/poweroff-google-cloud-cap-billing). Budget
   ~₹500, alerts 50/90/100%.
3. **`cloudrun.sh` changes for this phase:** `--max-instances 1` (was 4);
   region `us-central1` (was `asia-south1` — Mumbai is pricing Tier 2, burns
   the free allowance ~40% faster; free 1 GiB egress is NA-only; flip back at
   pilot). Trim to ≤6 secrets (Secret Manager free = 6 versions): keep real
   secrets, move `SUPABASE_URL`/`STRIPE_PRICE_ID`/dummy Stripe to env vars,
   **skip `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` entirely** — no DeepSeek spend this phase, all
   text routes to Flash.
4. **Privacy line = end of ₹0 phase:** Gemini free tier content is "used to
   improve" Google products (training); paid tier is excluded. Test questions
   fine; real students' questions NOT (DPDP). First real student ⇒ attach
   billing to the Gemini project, flip paid, restore DeepSeek/2.5-pro routing.
5. **Supabase free projects pause after ~1 week idle** → dead backend. Put a
   free uptime pinger (UptimeRobot) on `/healthz` every 5 min.
Cloud Run free tier itself (2M req / 180k vCPU-s / 360k GiB-s per month) fits
~6k solves/mo — not the constraint; Flash's 250 req/day is.
